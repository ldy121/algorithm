Farmers raise cattle in flat fields.

But there is a farmer who grow cattle in three dimensional coordiates.

He grows N cows and M horses.

There are all cows on the line x=c[1], y=0.

Also the horses are on the line x=c[2], y=2.

The last study involves cases where a cow is very close to a horse and can produce abnormal carbon.

The difinition of the distance between them is dist (P,Q) = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| + |z2 - z1| (P = (x1, y1, z1), Q = (x2, y2, z2))

He wants to anaylze the farm due to research result.

He wants to know the number of shortest distance couples.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the value T which indicates the number of test cases.

The first line of test cas contains value N in the number of cows and M in the number of horses (1 <= N,M <= 500000)

The second line of test case contains C1 and C2 (-100000000 <= C1, C2 <= 100000000)

The third line of test case contains locations of cows (C1, 0, Z[i]) (-100000000 <= Z[i] <= 100000000)

The fourth line of test case contains positions of horses (C2, 0, Z[j]) (-100000000 <= Z[j] <= 100000000)

The location of each cow ands horses are in different positions, but a cow and horse can be in the same position.

[ Print ]

Print '#' (x means test case number starting at 1)

Print the shortest distance between cow and horse couple.

And print the number of couples.

[ Input Example ]
2			// The number of test cases
3 4			// The first test case for N, M
1 -3			// The first test case for C1, C2
3 0 6			// The number of numbers N, locations of cows
-2 5 4 2		// The number of numbers M, location of horses
5 5			// The second test case of N, M
1 2
-4 -10 -2 0 -1
3 18 0 1 5

[ Output Example ]
#1 5 3			// The result of the first test case
#2 1 1			// The result of the second test case
