There is a company entrance exam through programming.

N people with numbers from 1 to N are here.

They compete to solve T problems.

There is no partial score, and the score is measured as pass or fail.

The problem score is calculated as the number of people who failed.

All attendees have their total score.

Ranking is measured by:

	- A person with high score is ranked higher.

	- If the scores are same, the person who solve more problems is ranked higher.

	- If the score and the number of problem are equal, a lower number person is ranked higher.

There is a person who has P participant number.

Create a program to get his rank and score.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the TC that represents the number of test cases.

The first line of test case contains N, T and P with spaces. (1 <= P <= N <= 2000, 1 <= T <= 2000)

The lines contains 0s or 1s, 0 indicates that the person did not resolve the problem.

A value of 1 indates that the attendee solved the problem.

Print #x (x means test case number starting at 1).

Print his score and rank with a blank

[ Input Example ]
2			// The number of test cases
5 3 2			// The first test case N = 5, T = 3, P = 2
