There is a person who likes Blackjack a lot.

There are 52 cards in the Blackgack game.
There are four cards each, from 2 to 9.
And there are four cards in 11 points.
Finally there are 16 cards for 10 points.

At first, all of cards turned upside down.
A player wants the sum of the card value to be less than 21.

Therefore if the player has already drawn N cards,
there will still be 52-N cards on the deck
The player is thinking whether or not he wants to take a card.

So if the number of card making it equal or greater than 21 is greater than
the number of cards making less than 21, the player will give up the game.

Please make a program that decides to take a card.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the TC for the number of test cases
From the second line, there is input information for each test case

First line is for the number of the cards N (1 <= N <= 52)
From the second line of each test case,
there are N lines for the value of the card selected by the player.
There is no out of state condition.
(Each card value is from 2 to 11 and
the same card can not be displayed more than four times)

[ Output ]

Print '#T' (T means test case number from 1).
When the player give up, print 'STOP'
When the player will take a card, print 'GAZUA'

[Input Example]
3		// The number of test case TC = 3
6		// For the first test case N = 6
2		// Cards the player picked up = [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]
