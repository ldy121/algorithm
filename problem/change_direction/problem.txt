It moves from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

It is possible move from (x,y) to (x + 1, y) or (x - 1, y) or (x, y + 1), or (x, y- 10.

(x + 1, y) or (x - 1, y) is a horizontal shift.

(x, y - 1) or (x, y + 1) is a vertical shift.

A person thought it is not funny to move from (x1, x1) to (x2, y2).

If it is a horizontal movement of the previous turn, it moves vertically in this turn.

If it is a vertical movement of the previous turn, it moves horizontally in this turn.

It is possible to do either way on the first turn.

Please create a program to get the minimum shift that can be reached from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

[ Input ]

The first line contains T that represents the number of test cases.

The first line of test case contains four numbers x1,y1,x2,y2 (-100 <= x1,y1,x2,y2 <= 100)

[ Output ]

Print #x (x mean test case number starting at 1)

Print the minimum movement.
