There are N numbers, and we have to select two numbers as pair.

When selecting two numbers, there is a condition.

If we define the two numbers as x and y, the multiplication of x and y consists of an increasing sequence and consecutive numbers.

For example, 2, 23, 23456, 56789 are satisfied above condition.

But 51, 54321, 67890, 89012, 88, 889, 79 do not meet the above condition.

The maximum value of the multiplication of two number that satisfy the above condition is the best pair.

Create a probelm whether there is a best pair or not.

If so, calculate multiplication of the best pair.

[ Input ]

The first line contains TC value which represents the number of test cases.

Then, each test case includes folowing:

	- The first line of each test case contains N which represents the number of numbers (1 <= N <= 1000)

	- The second line of each test case has N numbers, each number ranging from 1 to 10000.

[ Output ]

Print #x (x mean test case number starting at ) first.

Then print multiplication of the best pair.

If there is no the best pair, print -1
