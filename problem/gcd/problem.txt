He gives a problem to him.

If he answer the problem, he can buy some pizzas.

The problem is related to GCD.

GCD(a,0) = a
GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a % b)

The GCD function has the above functions.

The person has to find numbers A,B (A>B).

The pizza seller will provide the value K how many of % operations executed

If there are multiple combinations A B, then choose a combination that contains the minimum value of A.

For example % operations are executed three times, the combinations A B can be (5,3), (8,3) and (10,6).

And you have to choose (5,3) because A is minimum in the list.

Please create a program to find out A B combination.

There is the T value that indicates the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the K value representing the number of % operations.

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x means test case number starting at 1).

Then print A B combination with a space (A>B)

[ Input Example ]
3			// The number of test cases
1			// The first test case K = 1
3
20

[ Output Example ]
#1 2 1			// The first test case result
#2 5 3
#3 17711 10946
