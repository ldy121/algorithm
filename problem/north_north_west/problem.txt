We can express any particular direction such as east, west, north and north.

For example, northwest indicates the middle of north and west, northnorthwest indicates the middle of north and northwest.

You have to indicate direction north and west.

- north indicates 0 degree.
- west indicates 90 degree.

North dir = a - (90 / 2 ^ n)
West  dir = a + (90 / 2 ^ n)

West : dir = 90
NorthWest : dir = 90 - (90/2) = 45
NorthNorthWest = 45 - (90/2^2) = 45/2

Create a program to get a direction and degree.

[ Input ]

The first line contains T value which indicates the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a string.

The sum of "north" and "west" is from 1 to 20.

[ Output ]

Print #x (x means test case number starting at 1).

Print the direction and degree.

If the degree is not possible to express as number, please print as a fraction.
