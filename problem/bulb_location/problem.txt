A person has a light bulb that is off.

He can use a switch to turn on the bulb.

If the switch works well, the bulb operation will work properly.

So if the bolb is off, it will be on.

If the bulb is on, it will be off.

Unfortunately the switch may or may not work properly.

There is a probability p value which indicates that the bulb is working properly.

Please create a program to get the probability that a peron touch the switch N times to get the light on.

[ Input ]

The first line contains T value which indicates the number of test case.

The first line of each test case contains the real number p(0 <= p <= 1) and the number N(1 <= N <= 10000000000000) with a space.

p can decimal point of 6th digit.

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x mean test case number starting at 1).

Print the probability of light on.

[ Input Example ]

0.7 1
0.000001 1000000000

[ Output Example ]
#1 0.7
#2 0.5
