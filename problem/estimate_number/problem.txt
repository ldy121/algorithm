There are two people

They are playing a number-matching game.

The rule of the game is very simple.

The player thinks the number and the other player asks a few questions for match.

There are N questsions.

The player can ask a question about four numbers at a time.

The other player has to answer the question to see whether the number he thinks is on the list.

If the number is in the question, he has to say YES

But if not, he should say NO

Create a program for the number matching game.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the number of test cases

From second line, there is information about each test case.

The first line of test case has the number of questions.

Then there are as many lines as there are questions.

And each line contains four numbers and an answer (YES or NO)

The four numbers and the answer are seperated by a space.

The questions and answers in the test cases provide us enough information to get the number that the player thinks.

[ Output ] 

In all test cases, print '#x' (x means test number and starts at 1)

Print the number that the player thinks.

[ Input Example ] 
1				# the number of test case = 1
3				# the number of questions = 3
0 5 4 2 YES			# 0, 5, 4, 2 there is the number a player thinks in the list
4 0 1 9 NO			# 4, 0, 1, 9 there is not the number a player thinks in the list
2 8 7 6 NO			# 2, 8, 7, 6 there is not the number a player thinks in the list

[ Output Example ]
#1 5				# test case result
