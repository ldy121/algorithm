There are N different numbers.

You can choose K different numbers that satisfy the conditions below.

1 <= i < K

A[i] < A[i + 1] and A[i] is divisor of A[i + 1]

You have to get the longest K value with satisfication of above condition.

[ Input ]

There is a T value that indicates the number of test cases.

Each test case has an N value that represents the number of digits.

Also, the same value does not exist multiple time in each test case.

[ Output ]

Print '#x(x means test number and it starts from 1)' first.
After '#x' you print the longest possible length K.

[Input Example]
2			# Number of test
5			# N = 5
1 2 3 4 5
6
1 12 4 3 48 6

[Output Example]
#1 3			# the result of the first test case
#2 5
