To think about program below.

while (N > 1) {
	if (N mod 2 == 0) N = N / 2;
	else N = 3 * N + 1;
}

Above program is not confirmed for all numbers if the program can finish.

A person created a similar program based on the above program.

while (N > 1) {
	if (N mod 2 == 0) N = N / 2;
	else N = 3 * N + 3;
}

He expected that the above program could be completed for all numbers.

If there is a number N, create program to make sure it is complete or not.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the TC value for the number of test cases.

The second line contains the number N. (1 <= N <= 100000000000000)

[ Output ]

Print '#x' ( x means test case number starting at 1 )

Print YES when the program can be completed.

Print NO when the program can not be completed.

[ Input Example ]
2		// the number of test cases
3		// the first test case N = 3
4		// the second test case N = 4

[ Output Example ]
#1 NO		// the first test case result
#2 YES		// the second test case result
