Use the first two numbers to creata program that represents two significant digits.

For example if there is a number 588235, it is possible to express 5.88235 * 10^5.

In that case, the number can be expressed as 5.9 * 10^5 rounded to the second decimal place.

There is another example. For 9999, it will be possible to be expressed as 9.999 * 10^3.

And if it is adjusted by rounding it to the second decimal place, it can be expressed as 1.0 * 10^4

[ Input ]

The first line contains the number of the test case.

After that, a new line can seperate each test case.

Every test case has a number N (10^2 <= N <= 10^100000)

[ Output ]

In all test cases, print '#t'(t means test case number starting at 1).

Print first two significant digits using example format

[ Input Example ]
4				# the number test case = 4
100				# the first test case N = 100
999				# the second test case
588235				# the third test case
60221409000000000000000		# the fourth test case

[ Output Example ]
#1 1.0 * 10^2			# the result of first test
#2 1.0 * 10^4			# the result of second test
#3 5.9 * 10^5			# the result of third test
#4 6.0 * 10^23			# the result of fourth test
