There is a sequence of N length.

The sequcne contains values from 1 to N once.

The best sequence is that all i have to satisify i = p[i] mod 3.

For example the sequence (4,2,6,1,5,3) is a good, but (2,3,1,5,6,4) sequence is not.

You have to change a sequence to become good. Only positions of two numbers can be exchanged.

Create a program to get the minimum exchage number to make a good sequence.

[ Input ]

The first line contains T values which indicates the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contain the number N (3 <= N <= 999).

N is a multiple of 3.

The second line contains N numbers P[1],P[2],...,P[N] with a space (1 <= P[i] <= N).

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x means test case number.

Print the minimum exchange number to make a good sequence.
