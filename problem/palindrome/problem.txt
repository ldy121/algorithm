The Palindrome is the same even when turned upside down.

For example, '0_0', '404', 'appa' are Palindrome, but'umma', 'koosaga', krill' are not Palindrome.

A person does not like the fact that there is a string whose length is greater than 2 in Palindrome.

A string contains only three lowercase letters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

A person wants to mix lowercase letters to destroy Palindrome which is greater than 2 in length.

Create program to determine if it is possible or not.

[ Input ]

The first line contains the TC value for the number of test cases.

Then test cases are separated by new line.

Test case includes:

	- The first line of test case contains a string containg only 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x mean test case number starting at 1)

Print if there is no Palindrome combination, print 'YES'.

If not, print 'NO'

[ Input Example ]
3		// the number of test cases
abac		// the first test case string S = abac
aba
ccbabababac

[ Output Example ] 
#1 YES		// the first test case result
#2 NO
#3 YES
