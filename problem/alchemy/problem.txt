Someone is training to make N materials for alchemy.

The types of the materials are 1 to N

Mateirals are commonly used, and easy to purchase.

When the person buys the i materials, the person has to pay price of C[i].

The person will buy materials, and change the materials in the middle of process.

When the person changes materials, all the material changes i material to i + material.

Particular, N materill is changed to 1 material.

The change cost is R.

There are expensive materials. The person uses to the change appropriately to lower the price.

The person wants all the materials. Create a program to all the materials at the lowest cost.

[ Input ]

The first line contains T value that represents the number of test cases.

The first line of test case contains two number N and R separated by a space.
(2 <= N <= 2000, 1 <= R <= 1000000000)

In the second line, N and C[1], C[2], .. C[n] are separated by a space.
(1 <= C[i] <= 1000000000)

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x indicates test case number starting at 1).

Print the lowest cost the someone can get all materials.

[ Input Example ]
2			// The number of test cases
2 3			// The first test case N = 2, R = 3
1 999			// The first test case C[1] = 1, C[2] = 999
3 2
1 3 999

[ Output Example]
#1 5			// The first test case result
#2 7
