There is an array of n length.

Someone properly separates it into to partially contiguous arrays.

Partial arrays are sorted in ascending or descending order.

How can he archieve his purpose with minimal partitioning?

[ Input ]

The first line contains the TC value for the number of test cases.

TC test cases are seperated by a newline.

Each test case includes:

The first line of test case has value n for length of the array (1 <= n <= 100000)

After that, there are n number. A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^9)

[ Output ]

Print '#x' (x means the test case number starting at 1)

Print minimum number of paritions.

[ Input Example ]
3				# the number of test cases
4				# the fist test case n = 4
1 1 1 1				# A[1] = 1, A[2] = 1, A[3] = 1, A[4] = 1
6
1 2 4 3 3 1
9
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1

[ Output Example ]
#1 1				# the result of test case
#2 2
#3 5
