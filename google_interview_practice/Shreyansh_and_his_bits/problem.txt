Shreyansh has an integer N.
He is really curious about the binary representation of integers.
He sees that any given integer has a number of set bits. Now he wants to find out that how many positive integers, strictly less than N, have the same number of set bits as N.
He is a little weak in maths. Help him find the number of integers.
Note : Since N takes large values, brute force won't work.

Input : 
First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output : 
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.

Constraints : 
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10^12

Example : 
Input : 
3
8
1
4

Output : 
3
0
2

Explanation : 
Case 1 : 
Binary representation of 8 : 1000
So the integers less than 8 with same number of set bits are : 4, 2, 1

Case 2 : 
Binary representation of 1 : 1
There are no positive integers less than 1.

Case 3 : 
Binary representation of 8 : 100
So the integers less than 4 with same number of set bits are : 2, 1
