Minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it
Given two strings A and B. The task is to find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it.
If no such solution exsits print -1.

Examples:

Input : A = “abcd”, B = “cdabcdab”
Output : 3
Repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it. B is not a substring of A when it is repeated less than 3 times

Input : A = “ab”, B = “cab”
Output : -1
