Given a vector of N positive integers and an integer X. The task is to find the frequency of X in vector.

Input Format:
First line of input contains number of testcases T.
For each testcase there will be three lines. First line of which contains N, size of vector.
Second line contains N positive integers seperated by space, and third line contains X, whose frequency is required.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print the frequency of X.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function findFrequency() which should count the frequency of X and return it.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= V[i] <= 1016

Example:
Input:
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
Output:
5

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Frequency of 1 is 5.
