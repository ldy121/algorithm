Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be made using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the string.

Output:
Output the count of the strings that can be formed under the given constraint.

Constraints:

1<= T <=100
1<= N <=1000

Example:

Input:
2
1
3

Output:
3
19

Explanation:
Test Case 1: N = 1
Possible strings are: "a", "b" and "c"

Test Case 2: N = 3
Number of strings with 3 occurrances of a: 1
2-a and 1-b: 3
2-a and 1-c: 3
1-a, 1-b and 1-c: 6
1-a and 2-c: 3
1-b and 2-c: 3
Hence, total number of strings of length 3 = 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 19
