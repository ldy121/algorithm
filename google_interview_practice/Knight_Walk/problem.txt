Given a chess board of order N x M and source points (s1, s2) and destination points (d1, d2).
The task to find minimum number of moves required by the Knight to go to the destination cell.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases.
Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines.
The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N and M.
Then in the next line are four space separated values s1, s2 and d1, d2.

Output:
For each testcase in a new line print the minimum number of moves required by the knight to go to the destination from the source.
If no such move is possible print -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, M <= 25

Example:
Input:
2
4 7
2 6 2 4
7 13
2 8 3 4

Output:
2
3
