Given a BST and an integer K. Find the Kth Smallest element in the BST. 

Input:
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T.
For each test case, there will two lines.
The first line of input is a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where,
numbers denote node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:
 
For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

Second-line is an integer represents K

Output:
For each test case, the output will be the kth smallest element of BST.
If no such element exists then print -1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function KthSmallestElement() which takes the root of the BST and integer K as inputs and return the Kth smallest element in the BST.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000


Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
2 1 3
2
2 1 3
5
Output:
2
-1
