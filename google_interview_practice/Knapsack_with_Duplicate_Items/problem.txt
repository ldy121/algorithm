Given weights and values related to n items and the maximum capacity allowed for these items.
What is the maximum value we can achieve if we can pick any weights any number of times for a total allowed weight of W?

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains two integers N and W denoting the number of items and the total allowed weight.
In the next two lines are space separated values of the array denoting values of the items (val[]) and their weights (wt[]) respectively.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the  maximum value which we can achieve if we can pick any weights any number of times for a bag of size W.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, W <= 103
1 <= wt[], val[] <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
2 3
1 1
2 1 
4 8
1 4 5 7
1 3 4 5
Output:
3
11
