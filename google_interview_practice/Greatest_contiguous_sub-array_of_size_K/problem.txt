Greatest contiguous sub-array of size K
Given an array arr[] of integers and an integer K, the task is to find the greatest contiguous sub-array of size K.
Sub-array X is said to be greater than sub-array Y if the first non-matching element in both the sub-arrays has a greater value in X than in Y.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2, 5}, K = 4
Output: 4 3 2 5
Two subarrays are {1, 4, 3, 2} and {4, 3, 2, 5}.
Hence, the greater one is {4, 3, 2, 5}

Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 2, 7, 9, 3}, K = 3
Output: 9 2 7
