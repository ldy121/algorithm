Move all occurence of letter ‘x’ from the string s to the end using Recursion
Given a string s, our task is to move all the occurrence of letter x to the end of the string s using recursion.

Note: If there are only letter x in the given string then return the string unaltered.

Examples:

Input: s= “geekxsforgexxeksxx”
Output: geeksforgeeksxxxxx
Explanation:
All occurrence of letter ‘x’ is moved to the end.

Input: s = “xxxxx”
Output: xxxxx
