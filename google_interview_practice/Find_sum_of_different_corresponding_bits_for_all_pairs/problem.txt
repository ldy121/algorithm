We define f (X, Y) as number of different corresponding bits in binary representation of X and Y.
For example, f (2, 7) = 2, since binary representation of 2 and 7 are 010 and 111, respectively.
The first and the third bit differ, so f (2, 7) = 2.

You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,…, AN.
Find sum of f(Ai, Aj) for all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. Return the answer modulo 109+7.

Input:
The first line of each input consists of the test cases.
The description of T test cases is as follows:
The first line of each test case contains the size of the array, and the second line has the elements of the array.

Output:
In each separate line print sum of all pairs for (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N and return the answer modulo 109+7.

Constraints:
	1 ≤ T ≤ 70
	1 ≤ N ≤ 104
	-2,147,483,648 ≤ A[i] ≤ 2,147,483,647

Example:
Input:
2
2
2 4
3
1 3 5

Output:
4
8

Working:
A = [1, 3, 5] 

We return

f(1, 1) + f(1, 3) + f(1, 5) +
f(3, 1) + f(3, 3) + f(3, 5) +
f(5, 1) + f(5, 3) + f(5, 5) =

0 + 1 + 1 +
1 + 0 + 2 +
1 + 2 + 0 = 8
