Given two sequences A, B, find out number of unique ways in sequence A, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence B.

Example :
A = "abcccdf"  B = "abccdf"

Return 3. And the formations as follows:

A1= "ab.ccdf"
A2= "abc.cdf"
A3="abcc.df"

"." is where character is removed.


Input:
First line contains the test cases T.  1<=T<=500
Each test case have two lines
First is a string A of length less than 1000.
Second is a string B of length less than 100.

Exapmle:
Input:
2
abcccdf
abccdf
uwnny
uwnny

Output:
3
1
